Peripherals are connected to the microcomputer through electronic circuits known as interfacing circuits.

Module: PPI 8255 is a general purpose programmable I/O device designed to interface the CPU with its outside world such as ADC, DAC, keyboard etc. We can program it according to the given condition. It can be used with almost any microprocessor. It consists of three 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports i.e. PORT A, PORT B and PORT C.
