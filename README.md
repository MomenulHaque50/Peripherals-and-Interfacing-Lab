Peripherals are connected to the microcomputer through electronic circuits known as interfacing circuits.

Module: 

PPI 8255 is a general-purpose programmable I/O device designed to interface the CPU with its outside world such as ADC, DAC, keyboard, etc. We can program it according to the given condition. It can be used with almost any microprocessor. It consists of three 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports i.e. PORT A, PORT B, and PORT C. 

8051 microcontroller was designed by Intel in 1981. It is an 8-bit microcontroller. It is built with 40 pins DIP (dual inline package), 4kb of ROM storage and 128 bytes of RAM storage, and 2 16-bit timers. It consists of four parallel 8-bit ports, which are programmable as well as addressable as per the requirement. An on-chip crystal oscillator is integrated into the microcontroller having a crystal frequency of 12 MHz.
